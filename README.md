## Contributing

### Using Construct 3

Red Tie Runner was originally developed in Construct 2 but has since been ported to [Construct 3](https://www.construct.net/en). For those interested in the original version, it remains accessible on the `construct-2` branch.

### Git 
For construct 3, I recommend using [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for a clearer display of pending changes.

#### Working with Branches
To make sure the main game remains stable, don't make changes directly to the `main` or `dev` branch. Instead:

1. Create a new branch for each set of changes or features you want to work on.
2. Make sure your branch is up-to-date with the `dev` branch before starting.
3. Once you've finished your changes, push your branch to the repository.

#### Making a Pull Request (PR)
When you're ready to have your changes reviewed and possibly merged into the main game:

1. Create a new pull request with a description of your changes.
2. The maintainers  will review your PR. They might request some changes or merge it directly into `dev`, where it will pend a merge into `main`, at which point it may be republished on platforms.

Remember: Keeping your PRs smaller and focused on one thing makes them easier to review and merge.
